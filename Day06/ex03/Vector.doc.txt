<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vector in direct orthonormal basis.
The Vector is composed of 4 coordinates (x, y, z and w).

An instance can be constructed with a destination Vertex and an origin Vertex.
The origine Vertex is optional.

The class provides the following methods :

float	magnitude();
Return the Vector norm.

Vector	normalize();
Return the Vector after normalization. If the Vector is already normalized,
it return a copy of the Vector.

Vector	add( Vector $rhs );
Return the sum of 2 Vectors.

Vector	sub( Vector $rhs );
Return the difference of 2 Vectors.

Vector	opposite();
Return the opposite of Vector.

Vector	scalarProduct( $k );
Return the product of Vector with a scalar.

float	dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Return the scalar product of 2 Vectors.

float	cos( Vector $rhs );
Return the angle cosinus between 2 Vectors.

Vectort	crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Return the vectorial product of 2 Vectors.
